# AppFlow CloudFormation Template Examples

This repository contains CloudFormation templates that can be used as a starting point to learn how to use Amazon AppFlow as an infrastructure-as-code. 

Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables customers to securely transfer data between SaaS applications like Salesforce, Marketo, Slack, and ServiceNow, and AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift. 

These templates are provided for learning purposes only, and are not intended for use in production environments. Please note that this repository represents the personal work of the owner, and if you choose to use any of the resources, consider hardening security and following least privileged principles.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy a CloudFormation stack using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to the CloudFormation service
3. Click on the "Create stack" button
4. Choose "Upload a template file" and select the desired template from the repository
5. Follow the prompts to configure the stack options, such as stack name, AppFlow connections, and data source configuration
6. Review and confirm the stack creation, and wait for the stack to complete provisioning

Please note that any resources provisioned via CloudFormation are likely to incur charges, and it is important to monitor these charges closely. I recommend that you delete the CloudFormation stack and any associated resources after you have finished with your learning.
